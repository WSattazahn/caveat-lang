# Phase base

## The beat

Vessel's slime finds glowing mushrooms that all look alike. Glowcaps make it
glow for 30 s. Duskcaps make it heavy for 20 s. The slime can absorb a
mushroom, which consumes it and reveals its kind through the effect, or taste
one, which identifies that mushroom without consuming it. What it has learned
changes what the HUD tells the player, what it will agree to absorb, and what
its journal says, and the journal explains why.

Base level: `cave`, `pool`, `ruin`. Scenarios report each mushroom's true kind
in their events; the policy never knows a kind until it is absorbed or tasted.

### Events (host → policy)

| Event | Payload | Rejected when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `absorb` | `id`, `kind` (`glowcap`/`duskcap`) | unknown id or kind; mushroom consumed; `canAbsorb` false; kind contradicts a previous taste |
| `taste` | `id`, `kind` | unknown id or kind; mushroom consumed; mushroom already tasted |
| `tick` | `dt`, 0 ≤ dt ≤ 0.1 | dt out of range |

A rejected event throws and must leave the view exactly as it was.

### Effects

- Absorbing a glowcap sets the glow timer to 30 s; a duskcap sets the heavy
  timer to 20 s. `tick` lowers both timers by `dt`, not below 0.
- `slime.glowing` is glow timer > 0; `slime.heavy` is heavy timer > 0.

### Knowledge

- **Evidence ids** are `absorb_<id>` and `taste_<id>`.
- A mushroom is *known* once tasted (sweet = glowcap, bitter = duskcap).
- The **belief** about glowing mushrooms comes from absorptions only:
  `supportedBy` = glowcap absorptions, `contradictedBy` = duskcap absorptions.

| belief.state | when | text | note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | nothing absorbed | `""` | `""` |
| `probably_safe` | support, no contradiction | `Glowing mushrooms give you light.` | `Based on one observation.` / `Based on N observations.` (N = supportedBy count) |
| `probably_unsafe` | contradiction, no support | `Glowing mushrooms make you heavy.` | same form, N = contradictedBy count |
| `uncertain` | both | `Not every glowing mushroom is safe. Taste before absorbing.` | `""` |

### Decision

`trust` = "absorb glowing mushrooms without tasting".

- **Committed** the first time the belief becomes `probably_safe`.
  `basis` = the evidence that made it so. The basis is frozen: later support
  does not change it.
- **Reopened** by every duskcap absorption after it was committed.
  `reopenedBy` lists them in order. It is never recommitted in this beat.
- `state`: `none`, `committed`, or `reopened`.

### Mushroom view (every mushroom in the level)

| Condition (first match) | label | canAbsorb | canTaste | because |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| consumed | `""` | false | false | `[]` |
| tasted glowcap | `Glowcap` | true | false | `[taste_<id>]` |
| tasted duskcap | `Duskcap — avoid` | false | false | `[taste_<id>]` |
| belief `none` | `Glowing mushroom` | true | true | `[]` |
| belief `probably_safe` | `Probably a glowcap` | true | true | supportedBy |
| belief `probably_unsafe` | `Probably a duskcap` | true | true | contradictedBy |
| belief `uncertain` | `Could be a duskcap — taste first` | true | true | supportedBy ∪ contradictedBy |

`present` is false only when consumed. Evidence lists are compared as sets.

### View shape

```js
{
  slime: { glowing, heavy },
  mushrooms: { <id>: { present, label, canAbsorb, canTaste, because } },
  belief: { state, text, note, supportedBy, contradictedBy },
  decision: { state, basis, reopenedBy },
}
```

Each implementation exports `createPolicy()` returning `{ dispatch(event), view() }`.
Whatever glue an implementation needs to produce this shape counts as its code.
